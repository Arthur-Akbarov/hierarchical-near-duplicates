The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val
    The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val string pointer\. NULL is returned if the sequence is empty\.
        A BerVarray \* should be supplied.*? The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val string pointer\. NULL is returned if the sequence is empty\.
        Sequence of octet strings with lengths\. A BerVarray \* should be supplied, which upon return points to a dynamically allocated array of struct berval’s containing the octet strings and their lengths\. The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val string pointer\. NULL is returned if the sequence is empty\. The caller should free the returned structures using ber_bvarray_fr ee\(\)\.
        This is a generalized form .*? The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val string pointer\. NULL is returned if the sequence is empty\.
        Sequence of octet strings with lengths\. This is a generalized form of the previous three formats\. A void \*\* \(ptr\) should be supplied, followed by a ber_len_t \* \(len\) and a ber_len_t \(off\)\. Upon return \(ptr\) will point to a dynamically allocated array whose elements are all of size \(\*len\)\. A struct berval will be filled starting at offset \(off\) in each element\. The strings in each struct berval reside in memory assigned to the BerElement and must not be freed by the caller\. The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val string pointer\. NULL is returned if the sequence is empty\. The number of elements in the array is also stored in \(\*len\) on return\. The caller should free the returned array using ber_memfree\(\) \.
    The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val\.
    Several octet strings\. An array of struct berval’s is supplied\. The array is terminated by a struct berval with a NULL bv_val\. Note that a construct like ’\{W\}’ is required to get an actual SEQUENCE OF octet strings\.
